Welcome to my new blog built with **Typstify** - a high-performance static site generator that supports both Markdown and Typst.

## Why Typstify?

Typstify offers several advantages:

1. **Blazing fast builds** - Built in Rust for maximum performance
2. **Dual format support** - Write in Markdown or Typst
3. **Built-in search** - Full-text search with WASM runtime
4. **Live reload** - Instant feedback during development

## Code Example

Here's a simple Rust example:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello from Typstify!");
}
```

## What's Next?

Check out the [documentation](/docs) to learn more about Typstify's features.

Happy writing! 🚀
